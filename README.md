# pro-readme-generator - April 12th 2022 - Carlos Sabbah

## Purpose / Functionality

This application will generate a professional README.md file using node.js based on the user's input. The user's input will be captured using the inquirer module and the file will be generated using the file system (fs) module in node.js. Some of the data that is generated in the README.md includes project title, description, Github profile, contact email, licensing badges, usage instructions, etc.

## Instructions on usage

1. Clone the main project then open up the project folder in your text editor.
2. Open up your terminal and make sure you are in the main folder using the 'cd' command if needed.
3. Type in 'node index.js' or 'node index' to execute the application and load up the chain of prompts (questions).
4. Answer all the prompts and once completed, your personal README.md file will be created.
