## Description

This application will generate a professional README.md file using node.js based on the user's input. The user's input will be captured using the inquirer module and the file will be generated using the file system (fs) module in node.js. Some of the data that is generated in the README.md includes project title, description, Github profile, contact email, licensing badges, usage instructions, etc.

## Instructions

1. Clone the main project then open up the project folder in your text editor.
2. Run 'npm install' in terminal to install node_modules with all dependencies.
3. Make sure you are in the main project folder using the 'cd' command.
4. Then type in 'node index.js' or 'node index' to execute the application and load up the chain of prompts (questions).
5. Answer all the prompts and once completed, your personal README.md file will be created.
