# pro-readme-generator - April 12th 2022 - Carlos Sabbah

## Purpose / Functionality

This application will generate a professional README.md file using node.js based on the user's input. The user's input will be captured using the inquirer module and the file will be generated using the file system (fs) module in node.js. Some of the data that is generated in the README.md includes project title, description, Github profile, contact email, licensing badges, usage instructions, etc.
